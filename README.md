# Credit Risk Analysis with Python

In this project, an analysis of the most significant factors influencing Home Loans has been conducted. HomeBank financial company operates in Urban, Semiurban, and Rural areas, and they employ application forms for mortgage applications as part of their working model. These forms collect essential customer information, including Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, and Loan Amount.

The main focus of this project was to examine the impact of these factors on the approval status of Loan/Mortgage applications.

### Hypothesis Generation:

1. Salary : Applicants with a higher salary should have higher loan approval rate
2. Loan Amount : Applicants with lower loan amount application should have higher loan approval rate
3. Credit History : Applicants with a better credit history should have higher loan approval rate

### Unvariate Analysis

In this analysis, each variable in the given data set will be analyzed individually and independently. For Categorical variables bar charts and for numerical variables density plots will be used.
